// LEVEL DESIGN

- Always add a concept unique to the game in every puzzle
- Only short and concise puzzles make for a more entertaining overall experience
- Make sure that the player always discover a new concept in a puzzle relatively easy and dedicated to this concept

Concepts unique to the game :
- Chain length
- Chain weight
- Anchor point for 'Tarzan' leap
- Moving anchor point
- Alternate door that blocks the chain
- Climbing the chain
- Chain pushs a lever
- Enabled/disabled anchor point
- adding/removing length to the chain

Basic platforming concept :
- countdown
- switch
- double effect switch
- bouncing tile
- propulsion tile
- slipping surfaces
- deadly surfaces
- movable obstacles

Brainstorming:
- movable obstacle not on the ground, so that the player can't use their chain to pull it from the ground
